# ez-vencord-install
vencord installer with stereo and other stuff (from philhk)

# Pre-requisites:
* make sure to uninstall any discord client mods you previously have installed beforehand.
* If you have an outdated version of node.js, the script will not update it. If you run into issues, uninstall node.js and run the script again, it'll automatically install the latest version.

# Instructions:
1. either clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/BlueberryWolf/ez-vencord-install), or download and extract the files of the repo

### if cloned from repo (git clone):
2. run updateandinstall.bat
### otherwise, or if you run into issues:
2. Run install.bat.

3. If the process is successful, it will ask you to install vencord.
4. Use the arrow keys and enter to navigate. Select "Install Vencord," then choose your flavour of discord (typically stable)
5. If your discord didn't automatically restart, fully close and re-open discord.
6. In your discord user settings, you will find a bunch of plugins. Read through them and enable the ones you want, then restart discord afterwards.

The plugins I added are: MessageLoggerEnhanced, BetterMicrophone, BetterScreenshare, Timezones, and Gif Collections
